<h1>ABOUT</h1>

<h2>VISUAL STUIDO CODE and DAVINCI RESOLVE</h2>

<p>Here, we will explain the basics of what programs such as VS code and Davinci resolve are and how they work.</p>

<br />

<h3>DAVINCI RESOLVE</h3>

        <p>
         DaVinci Resolve is a color grading, color correction, visual effects, and audio post-production video editing application for macOS, Windows, and Linux,
         developed by Blackmagic Design.  <br />
         It was originally developed by da Vinci Systems as da Vinci Resolve until 2009,
         when da Vinci Systems was acquired by Blackmagic Design.  <br />
         In addition to the commercial version of the software 
         (known as DaVinci Resolve Studio), Blackmagic Design also distributes a free edition, with reduced functionality, <br />
            simply named DaVinci Resolve (formerly known as DaVinci Resolve Lite).
        </p>

        <br />

<h3>VISUAL STUDIO CODE</h3>

    <p>
        Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs including websites,
        web apps, web services and mobile apps.  <br />
        Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms,
        Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight.  <br />
        It can produce both native code and managed code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring. <br />
        The integrated debugger works as both a source-level debugger and as a machine-level debugger. <br />
        Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer, 
         and database schema designer.<br />
          It accepts plug-ins that expand the functionality at almost every levelâ€”including adding support for source control 
         systems (like Subversion and Git) and adding <br />
         new toolsets like editors and visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other 
         aspects of the software development lifecycle (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer).</p>
